The simplest, most effective WordPress comment notifications plugin, enabling visitors to subscribe to comment replies and your email list in just one click.

== Description ==

=== Comment Notifications is the simplest comment plugin for WordPress, turning visitors and commenters into engaged leads, subscribers and sales. No code required!===

You work hard to get visitors to your website, and even harder creating content that is engaging enough to create conversation in the comment section...

In fact, people reading and writing comments are some of your MOST engaged visitors!

Consider the dedication required to read through an entire article, reach the comments, and then share personal thoughts with the world — that's true commitment!

And yet, the comment section is often one of the most overlooked areas of your WordPress website, and usually a dead end for your readers. That's because...

- there's no easy way for them to get notifications of new comments...
- no easy way to know if someone replies to one of their comments...
- no easy way to follow the conversations they're most interested in...
- no easy way to engage with you outside of the comments, even though they're the visitors most likely to do so...

UNTIL NOW!
